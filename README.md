# Geyser Recipe Fix

Allows Bedrock (Geyser) Players to use custom anvil and smithing recipes with custom menus.

#### This plugin will:
- Add a geyser texture pack (1 custom item)
- Override the anvil and smithing table menus for **ONLY** bedrock players (Java Players are not affected)
- Use packets so most any other plugin or datapack will work with it

#### installation:
1. Make sure [Geyser](https://geysermc.org/download) and/or [floodgate](https://geysermc.org/download#floodgate) is in your plugins
2. Download and install [ProtocolLib](https://ci.dmulloy2.net/job/ProtocolLib/lastSuccessfulBuild/) (If you don't already have it)
2. Download and place in the plugins folder (This is **NOT** a geyser extension, It's a separate plugin that hooks into geyser)
3. Restart/Start server
